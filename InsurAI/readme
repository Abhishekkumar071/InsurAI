🧠 InsurAI – Smart Insurance Management Platform


InsurAI is a full-stack web-based insurance platform designed to digitalize and automate the traditional insurance process.
It allows users to discover, compare, and apply for insurance policies online, while enabling admins/agents to manage policies and applications efficiently through a secure dashboard.

The platform is built using React (Frontend), Spring Boot (Backend), and MySQL (Database), following industry-standard architecture and security practices.

InsurAI demonstrates how modern full-stack technologies can transform the insurance industry by making processes faster, smarter, and more user-friendly.
This project provided hands-on experience in building a real-world application and strengthened our foundation in software engineering.
